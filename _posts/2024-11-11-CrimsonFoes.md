At long last, the untold stories of the wardens of the realm's secrets. I hereby present to you: The Tales of the Crimson Foes, *a compilation of red team stories*.

# Prologue

> &rarr; Beware, reader, as this will **not** be a simple arrogant criticism, but rather a series of comical and relatable situations we found ourselves in, sprinkled with self reflection and introspection: *what could we have done better ?*
> &rarr; As my fellow Crimson Foes are aware, the technical aspect of the task can easily be overshadowed by haughty manners, or erroneous conveyance. Hence, displaying diplomacy and being understanding is *a very important aspect of what we do.*
> &rarr; As obvious as it can be: no confidential information will displayed here. As a matter of fact: *all characters and events in this tale--even those based on real people--are entirely fictional, any resemblance with actual events is also fortuitous.*
