At long last, the untold stories of the realm's secrets wardens. I hereby present to you: The Tales of the Crimson Foes, *a compilation of red team and pentest stories*.

# Prologue

We have been pretty busy lately, mainly with red team engagements. That goes to explain why this blog is growing more and more inactive. On the other hand, we have **plenty** to tell. And so what you will find here is a lot less technical than you might be used to, if you read our posts before. Here lies the main gist, I hope you have a good read:

> &rarr; Beware, reader, as this will **not** be a simple arrogant criticism, but rather a series of comical and relatable situations we found ourselves in, sprinkled with self reflection and introspection: <br>**what could we have done better ?**<br>
> &rarr; As my fellow Crimson Foes are aware, the technical aspect of the task can easily be overshadowed by haughty manners, or erroneous conveyance. Hence, displaying diplomacy and being understanding is *a very important part of what we do.*<br>
> &rarr; As obvious as it can be: no confidential information will displayed here. As a matter of fact: *all characters and events in this tale--even those based on real people--are entirely fictional, any resemblance with actual events is also fortuitous.*<br>

# Chapter 1 - The forbidden scroll of truth

It was a chill morning in November, and although I strongly dislike the cold gusts of wind that make the traveller's nose runny, I was excited to visit a new place I had never seen before. This mission was important. As I always do, I made sure I had the right companionship with me. That time, it was a man named M. He was the one who taught me the arts and crafts of Windows and Active Directory, at least most of it. So I knew we were the right force for the matter at hands.

As we, the Crimson Foes, enter the small village, the mist settles downs slowly and the sun starts shining in an eerie way. Faces turn and eyes are curious: we are seemingly out of place.

We are warmly greeted at the entrance of the building. A cheerful lady shows us the premises, and introduces us to the local workers. We even have our own room for ourselves. The day can start. The hack can happen.

8 A.M: we enter the main network. By lunch time we have the castle's keys. Nothing too surprising so far, they were not expecting *us*. Most things go just as usual.
