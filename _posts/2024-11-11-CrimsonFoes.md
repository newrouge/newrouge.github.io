At long last, the untold stories of the realm's secrets wardens. I hereby present to you: The Tales of the Crimson Foes, *a compilation of red team and pentest stories*.

# Prologue

We have been pretty busy lately, mainly with red team engagements. That goes to explain why this blog is growing more and more inactive. On the other hand, we have **plenty** to tell. And so what you will find here is a lot less technical than you might be used to, if you read our posts before. Here lies the main gist, I hope you have a good read:

> &rarr; Beware, reader, as this will **not** be a simple arrogant criticism, but rather a series of comical and relatable situations we found ourselves in, sprinkled with self reflection and introspection: <br>**what could we have done better ?**<br>
> &rarr; As my fellow Crimson Foes are aware, the technical aspect of the task can easily be overshadowed by haughty manners, or erroneous conveyance. Hence, displaying diplomacy and being understanding is *a very important part of what we do.*<br>
> &rarr; As obvious as it can be: no confidential information will displayed here. As a matter of fact: *all characters and events in this tale--even those based on real people--are entirely fictional, any resemblance with actual events is also fortuitous.*<br>

# Chapter 1 - The forbidden scroll of truth

It was a chill morning in November, and although I strongly dislike the cold gusts of wind that make the traveller's nose runny, I was excited to visit a new place I had never seen before. This mission was important. As I always do, I made sure I had the right companionship with me. That time, it was a man named M. He was the one who taught me the arts and crafts of Windows and Active Directory, at least most of it. So I knew we were the right force for the matter at hands.

As we, the Crimson Foes, enter the small village, the mist settles downs slowly and the sun starts shining in an eerie way. Faces turn and eyes are curious: we are seemingly out of place.

{: refdef}

We are warmly greeted at the entrance of the building. A cheerful lady shows us the premises, and introduces us to the local workers. We even have our own room for ourselves. The day can start. The hack can happen.

8 A.M: we enter the main network. By lunch time we have the castle's keys. Nothing too surprising so far, they were not expecting *us*. Most things go just as usual.

As the operation can be quite costly on the long run, our brains start to run dry. We decide to go for food and refreshments, as the clock strikes 12. The weather has now cleared, as it often does during the day in this region of the country. A local tavern quickly catches our interest, as it serves Turkish specialties us Crimson Foes relish.

Even more eyes on the Crimson Foes as they replenish themselves with what does not seem to be a local meal, neither is it consumed frequently in these surroundings. Villagers grow wary, and curious. This won't stop us. We are on a mission.

The end of the day arrives mechanically, without thinking about the time passing by. By then, most local workers in the premises we occupy have left home already. It has already been dark for a long time before I realize it. I am pretty M. hasn't even noticed yet. He too, is on a mission.

I call it a night. We have a few more days, let's not burn everything too quickly, we will likely need more energy in the coming days. Especially with what we were about to discover.
However M. is restless. Like most Crimson Foes, his mind is always on the lookout for details, leftover information, for us to explore and exploit.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/crimson/call.jpg)
{: refdef}

As the darkness now fully surrounds the little beach town, the mist has come back. A soft call breaks the silence like a sharpened sword swiftly shreds thin paper sheets.

> "M.: A., come. You should see this."<br>

M. is a very moderate man of a few words. A quiet and sharp man, as we like to call in our country "vis tranquilla". He does not exaggerate. He does not embellish. He uses people's attention very wisely. I knew better than not to take his advise seriously.

> "A.: What is it that delays my ale my dear companion?"<br>
> "M.: They left an artifact."<br>

he said, mincing his words.

> "M.: You will like it."<br>

His grinning smile made me understand only but one thing: Whatever he found will ultimately lead us to **more work**.

> "M.: 'Tis a scroll, a most perilous one."

{: refdef}

A leftover artifact in a printing machine, common and usually harmless. Except this time. <br>
The printer was located in a public area of the premises, which was commonly visited by villagers and travelers. Needless to say that the risk is only made greater by that single observation. But the content of the file is what made this story the legend we will tell our grandchildren:

It was there, the **forbidden scroll of truth**, the holy grail, containing every local workers personal information and ***plaintext currently valid passwords**. We knew exactly how **valid** and **currently used** they were, as we had spent a part of the afternoon breaking them using the dark prowess of the legendary RTX 4090.

> "A.: Lord, why choose me?"

I thought, looking at the ocean as if it carried answers.

> "A.: Why can't I be the bearer of good news for once alas?"
> "Lord.exe: The path you chose ultimately bequeathed on you this very duty, as you shall be the bringer of doom and despair, for a slighty higher salary."

I knew what I had to do.
