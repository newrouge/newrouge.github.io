# 0. Origins, and purpose

tricard was initially a simple recursive function for querying the registry. During red team engagements, it is quite common to try and understand what the devices are used for . One of the most common usages of this program was to find configurations linked to PuTTY, in order to identify ssh credentials, or simply to identify system administrators workstations. After being deployed many times for gathering information, it was noticed that our collect server was receiving surprising information: it was unintentionnaly collecting data coming from malware sandboxes. Our binary was analyzed by the tools deployed in our customers networks, and their sandboxes were also executing our program. That's when we found out another potential use for this simple auditing tool.


# 1. Compile and dispatch
All data is concatenated in a JSON array. As it can be very heavy very quickly, the JSON payload POST requests are compressed using Zlib. The client and server are configured to communicate over HTTPS.
# 1.1 Collector functions

### 1. `ListProcessesToJson(char* jsonData, size_t jsonDataLen)`: 
- **Overview:**
  - Lists running processes on the system.
  - Appends process information, including process name, to a JSON-formatted string.
  - JSON data is stored in the provided `jsonData` buffer.

### 2. `ListLoadedModulesToJson(char* jsonData, size_t jsonDataLen)`:
- **Overview:**
  - Lists loaded modules (DLLs) in running processes.
  - Appends module information, including module name, to a JSON-formatted string.
  - JSON data is stored in the provided `jsonData` buffer.

### 3. `GetPSHistory(char* jsonData, int jsonDataLen)`:
- **Overview:**
  - Retrieves PowerShell command history.
  - Encodes history in base64 and appends it to a JSON-formatted string.
  - JSON data is stored in the provided `jsonData` buffer.

### 4. `GetSysinfo(char* jsonData, int jsonDataLen)`:
- **Overview:**
  - Retrieves various system information (OS version, architecture, user information).
  - Encodes information in base64 and appends it to a JSON-formatted string.
  - JSON data is stored in the provided `jsonData` buffer.

### 5. `GetNetworkInterfacesJSON(char* jsonBuffer, size_t bufferSize)`:
- **Overview:**
  - Retrieves network interface information (MAC addresses, IP addresses).
  - Appends information to a JSON-formatted string.
  - JSON data is stored in the provided `jsonBuffer` buffer.

### 6. `GetBasicInfo(char* jsonData)`:
- **Overview:**
  - Retrieves basic system information (computer name, username, domain).
  - Initializes JSON data, storing it in the provided `jsonData` buffer.

### 7. `LoopFolders(char* jsonData)`:
- **Overview:**
  - Loops through specified folders (temporary folder and desktop).
  - Lists files in these folders, including details like filename, type, magic number, creation date, and modification date.
  - Appends file information to a JSON-formatted string stored in the provided `jsonData` buffer.

### 8. `SendGzipCompressedPOSTRequest(const char* postData)`:
- **Overview:**
  - Sends a POST request to a specified server with Gzip-compressed data.
  - Uses WinHTTP functions to open a session, connect, and send the request.
  - Compression is done using the zlib library.

### 9. `main()`:
- **Overview:**
  - Main function that orchestrates the collection and transmission of system information.
  - Calls various functions to gather and format system information.
  - Initiates a Gzip-compressed POST request to send the data to a server.
