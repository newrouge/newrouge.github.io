After nearly a year of absence, it is now time to conclude this adventure. Most of what will be described here will seem out of topic if you haven't read:

# Part 1: Summary

In <a href="https://therealunicornsecurity.github.io/Powervision-1/">Part 1</a>, we decrypted and retrieved the full firmware of the programmer,  in <a href="https://therealunicornsecurity.github.io/Powervision-2/">Part 2</a>, we reverse engineered the communication protocol on the USB link. Now holding all the cards, we can achieve our primary goal, that was **bypassing the licensing system** in place!



# Part 2: Licensing functions

# Part 3: Micropatching

# Part 4: Firmware update process


## References

[This post](https://blog.senr.io/blog/jtag-explained) gave me the idea for switching to single user mode in the boot parameters.

## In the next episode

- Firmware reverse engineering and emulation (focus on the USB Link proprietary protocol)
- Loot (passwords, encryption keys...)
- Buffer overflow
