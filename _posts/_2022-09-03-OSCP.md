How to pwn OSCP labs and exams ! (100 + 10 / 100 points)

# TLDR;

> Enumerate through thorough scans, do not overlook even the tiniest detail.
> Go breadth first, always.
> It's ok to fall in rabbit holes, proceed by elimination
> If you already are a skilled professional, it's ok to find some of the lab boxes hard. In fact, a few of them rely more on CTF style riddles than actual exploitation logic
> Do not underestimate the power of morale during the exam. Sugar, tee, coffee, sleep, r00t (going for low hanging fruits will boost your confidence).
