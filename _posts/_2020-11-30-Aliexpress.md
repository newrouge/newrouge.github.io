Captcha reuse in Aliexpress login form

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

I recently noticed (thanks to Chrome's form cache) that Aliexpress login captcha's were not random. Instead, it seems they are using a set of pre-generated images and sending user a random one from this set. This is, of course, not the right way to use captchas, especially if we add the fact that those are text captchas with very few transformations, making them easy to solve by an OCR.  
My goal here is not to demonstrate a successful attack against Aliexpress's login form, but instead just a simple PoC to show these captcha's weaknesses.

{: refdef}


# Part 1: Building a hashtable

The first step was knowing if the captcha request required authentication. This is the original request proxied:
{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/aliexpress/captcha_request.png)
{: refdef}

One of the first things I do when examining a request is stripping manually each get or post parameter, and HTTP headers, in order to discriminate the one needed by the application from the others. In this case, some parameters are needed, but they don't need to have a valid value. We use the following request to get captchas:

```
GET /captcha/image/get.jsonp?sessionid=random&identity=data&style=default&callback=callback HTTP/1.1
Host: usdiablo.alibaba.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:83.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/83.0
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: fr,fr-FR;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.5,en;q=0.3
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Referer: https://www.aliexpress.com/
```
The captchas received always contain 4 numbers and capital letters:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/aliexpress/captcha2.jpg)
{: refdef}

We can solve them using tesseract (https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract):
```bash
tesseract --psm 8 captcha.jpg - --dpi 100
â€” MRRP
```
Tesseract adds extra characters but in our case, we know all the captchas are 4 chararacters long, so the answer here is DPRP.  
I usually modify the input images to have better results with OCR, switching to grayscale or adding contrast:
```
convert captcha2.jpg  -type grayscale -quality 100 grayscale.jpg  
convert captcha2.jpg  -level 50% -quality 100 contrast.jpg
```
In this case it did not really help, but it is a good tip to keep in mind when handling captchas.


To make this more efficient, we can optimize the captcha's lookup time and save precomputed results:

# Part 3: Limitations

The automatic resolution of captchas challenges using tesseract is not very accurate for the moment. Building the hashtable manually is not very hard as the number of captchas is very limited. But to take this further, the next thing to improve would be this aspect. Solving automaticaly the captcha and saving the result in the hashtable is essential to make this program usable in a real life scenario. To take it a step forward, a feedback loop using the response from the server would add accuracy. Each captcha's solution could have a confident score that is decremented each time the solution is not validated by the server. A valid response from the server would, in the contrary, increase the confidence score. Captchas solutions with low confidence scores would then be recomputed to obtain new solutions, until a valid one is found.

There seems to be extra protections against this form, which I did not explore. In fact, when sending the captcha's response, it is also expected to send a parameter named "captchaToken"
```
{"answer":"DBPR","captchaToken":"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"}&a=CFUS_APP_HAVANALogin&t=CFUS_APP_HAVANALogin:XXXX
```
Supposedly it is randomly generated and uniquely identifies a captcha response submission, but we can already see they are not purely random and contain a sort of structure and headers:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/aliexpress/captcha_token.png)
{: refdef}

This token comes from the getcaptcha reponse so it does not really prevent from automatic form submission.  
There are many other parameters at stake in these requests (like a signature for example) and not knowing their exact roles, I will not mention them here.
