title: OSCP tips and tricks
---

A summary of my notes during the OSCP labs and certification. I also decided to add a few tips I use for actual engagements (red team, pentest, and a bit of reversing). A lot of the commands, tools, and tips come from other online guides (OSCP related or not), they are linked at the bottom of this post.

How to pwn OSCP labs and exams ! (100 + 10 / 100 points)

# TLDR;

> Enumerate through thorough scans, do not overlook even the tiniest detail.
> Go breadth first, always.
> It's ok to fall in rabbit holes, proceed by elimination.
> If you already are a skilled professional, it's ok to find some of the lab boxes hard. In fact, a few of them rely more on CTF style riddles than actual penetration testing logic.
> Do not underestimate the power of morale during the exam. Sugar, tee, coffee, sleep, r00t (going for low hanging fruits will boost your confidence). 

# Part 1 Information Gathering

For the labs and exam, I applied the same method over and over, and always obtained good results (except for UDP of course but what an annoying procotol).

## Ping Sweep

```bash
#! /bin/bash
for ip in $(seq 1 256); do
 fping -c 1 -t 500 $1.$ip 2>&1 |grep max|cut -d ':' -f1|tr -d ' '
done
```
