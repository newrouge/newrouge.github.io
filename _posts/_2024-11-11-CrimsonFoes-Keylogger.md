# Prologue

Sometimes missions require many more soft and hard skills than just the classic "computer stuff". It is especially true for red team engagements. This story highlights the importance of adaptability, improvisation, and quick thinking when under pressure. It is a tale of good and bad surprises, as well as gigantic failures, both on the blue team's side and the Crimson Foes'. I hope you have a good read:


# Chapter 2 - The wretchedly set snare

## Preamble - The snare

First of all and before aught else, I suppose it is necessary to define the nature of the device used in this story. The snare, or trap used here is known among Crimson Foes as a **Keylogger**.

Many variants exist, but we will focus on a simple USB version of the tool. The tool is quite simple, it has one input, and one output. It is supposed to be placed right between the target device, and it's original destination.

Stay classy netsecurios!
