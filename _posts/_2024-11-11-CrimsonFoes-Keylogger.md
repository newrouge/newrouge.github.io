# Prologue

We have been pretty busy lately, mainly with red team engagements. That goes to explain why this blog is growing more and more inactive. On the other hand, we have **plenty** to tell. And so what you will find here is a lot less technical than you might be used to, if you read our posts before. Here lies the main gist, I hope you have a good read:

> &rarr; Beware, reader, as this will **not** be a simple arrogant criticism, but rather a series of comical and relatable situations we found ourselves in, sprinkled with self reflection and introspection: <br>**what could we have done better ?**<br>
> &rarr; As my fellow Crimson Foes are aware, the technical aspect of the task can easily be overshadowed by haughty manners, or erroneous conveyance. Hence, displaying diplomacy and being understanding is a **very** important part of what we do.<br>
> &rarr; As obvious as it can be: no confidential information will be displayed here. As a matter of fact: *all characters and events in this tale --even those based on real people-- are entirely fictional, any resemblance with actual events is also fortuitous.*<br>
